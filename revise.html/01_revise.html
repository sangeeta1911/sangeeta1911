9 months in a womb,
I spelt, ate and kicked.

The day I was born,
There was dance, claps and beats.

When I was 8 every hand had a book.
But my hand was filled with sorrow, grief and tear.

Every mirror showed a smiling face,
But my mirror was others’ dirty plates.

Take me back to my mother's womb.
The safest place where one can be.

This world is not letting me live,
No joy to take, no love to give.

Let me study, let me learn,
Let me feel the dreams I yearn.

Let me run, let me play,
Let me fly far, far away.
    </pre>
