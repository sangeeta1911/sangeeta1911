    <h1> Doremon </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Doraemon (ドラえもん) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Fujiko F. Fujio. First serialized in 1969,
        the manga's chapters were collected in 45 tankōbon volumes published by Shogakukan from 1974 to 1996. The story
        revolves around an earless robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back from the 22nd century to help a boy
        named Nobita Nobi.</p>

    <p>The series ceased its original run in 1994 and was not given an ending before Fujimoto's death in 1996; this has
        since aroused numerous urban legends throughout the years.[28] One of the most well-known "endings" of the manga
        was by an amateur manga cartoonist under the pen name "Yasue T. Tajima", first appeared on the Internet in 1998
        and made up into a manga in 2005. The story takes place when Doraemon's battery dies, and Nobita later grows up
        becoming a robot engineer, potentially revive Doraemon and live a happy life. Tajima issued an apology in 2007,
        and the profits were shared with Shogakukan and the copyright owner, Fujiko F. Fujio Pro.</p>
